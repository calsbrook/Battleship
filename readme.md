## The Game
You are assisting comrade Stalin in defeating the capitalist forces of Darth Ronald Reagan.  First you strategically place your ships by clicking their name and your desired orientation.  The capitalists will randomly place their ships as well. Your radars have been damaged and all you can do is guess where their ships might be hiding.  Good luck comrade!

### Getting Started
If you're up to help comrade Stalin go to https://calsbrook.github.io/Battleship

### How It Works
During the ship placement stage, the enemy randomly hides all five of his ships after you place yours. Next during the guessing phase the enemy randomly guesses spots on the board until it finds a hit.  Once it records that the last turn was a successful hit, it tries the spaces next to the successful hit until it finds another successful hit.  It will continue along the working path until it sinks your ship.  After sinking a ship it will begin guessing randomly again.

### Next Steps
When I get back to this I want to add drag and drop ship placement and more fun banter.
